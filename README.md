This is my first ever "big" project that looking back now its actually small but at the time it was big for me, it is the final assignment for a subject in college.
There's couple of games there to play, Reversi and Battleship as the repository name displays, you can download it and play in your window, go easy since it was from when i was
starting to code in JavaScript and frameworkless.
Hope you like it! (it's hideous)
